Siyuan Liu will be joining the Control Systems (CS) group at [Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/) as an Assistant Professor, starting September 1st, 2025. 
She is currently a Wallenberg-NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow (Forskare) at the [Division of Decision and Control Systems](https://www.kth.se/is/dcs/division-of-decision-and-control-systems-1.788078) at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. From 2023 to 2024, she was a Digital Futures Postdoc Fellow at KTH. Before joining KTH, she was a research assistant in the [Hybrid Control Systems (HyConSys)](https://www.hyconsys.com/) Lab at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, Germany. 
She received her Ph.D. degree (in Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2022) from Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, her M.E. degree (in Control Engineering, 2017) and B.E. degree (in Automation Science, 2014)  both from Beihang University, China. In 2021, she was a visiting researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. 

Research Interest
======
* Compositional synthesis and verification of large-scale systems 
* Formal methods in control
* Multi-agent systems
* Safety and security in cyber-physical systems
* Nonlinear control systems
* Stochastic systems

PhD Opening
======
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to join our research team for a project focused on developing novel methodologies for the formal analysis and control of multi-agent cyber-physical systems (CPS). The project integrates techniques from control theory, formal methods, and multi-agent planning to address key challenges in the design of intelligent autonomous systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Applications are now open via the TU/e website:
